# sing
Youtube MP3 / MP4 downloader

## Get it
```
npm install sing -g
```

> I ship with the windows binary of `ffmpeg` as well for convenience. Other platforms you need to have [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) in their path.

## Usage
```
sing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CmadmM5cOk
```

And you get the mp4 (720p) file + mp3 appropriately titled after the youtube video.
